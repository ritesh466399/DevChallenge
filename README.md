# DevChallenge
The acquireLocks()  can safely acquire any number of locks in any order without causing deadlock, using the tryLock() method of ReentrantLock. 
 

Some of the points I will consider for Production Application:
Use Spring container Managed Transaction
Use Hibernate as ORM tool
USe JPA repository 
Use Caching for InMemory account
Use ldap for Database server
